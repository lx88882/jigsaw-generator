### Mathematical Jigsaw creation software

This software is designed to create Tarsia Formulator type
mathematical jigsaws using LaTeX.  The puzzle data is stored in a YAML
file, and the software turns it into a printable jigsaw.  This
software makes it reasonably straightforward to create multiple
jigsaw-style puzzles.

If you are using a Debian or Ubuntu system, you should be able to
install this software using a command such as:

```
sudo apt install jigsaw-generator
```

which will also install all prerequisites.  If you are installing on a
different system, see the `INSTALL.md` file for more information.

At present, this software does not work well on Windows.  If you would
like to help make it work on Windows, please do get in touch!
